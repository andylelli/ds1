# Gap Analysis: Modular, YAML-Driven Architecture

This document outlines the transition from the current hardcoded/monolithic state to a fully modular, configuration-driven system.

## 1. The YAML Configuration Strategy

To answer "what can be spun up from YAML", the goal is **everything**. The code should be a generic engine; the YAML defines the specific application instance.

**Key Principle: Architectural Symmetry**
The system structure is **identical** in both Simulation and Live modes.
*   **Live Mode**: Driven by Real Events (Webhooks) -> Processed by Agents -> Actions on Real APIs.
*   **Sim Mode**: Driven by Synthetic Events (Orchestrator) -> Processed by Agents -> Actions on Mock APIs (Generative).

We propose a **5-File Configuration Structure**:

| File | Purpose | What it Controls |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. ootstrap.yaml** | **Entry Point** | Environment mode (Live/Sim), Log levels, paths to other config files. |
| **2. infrastructure.yaml** | **Plumbing** | **Event Bus provider** (Postgres), Database connections, Server ports. |
| **3. mcp.yaml** | **Tools/IO** | **MCP Servers** (Stdio/SSE) and **Internal Adapters**. Defines *capabilities*. |
| **4. gents.yaml** | **Workers** | Which Agents to spawn, their System Prompts, Model settings, and assigned Tools (MCP Servers). |
| **5. workflows.yaml** | **Wiring** | Event Subscriptions. Who listens to what? (e.g., OrderPaid -> FulfillmentAgent). |

## 2. Detailed Gap Analysis

### A. Modular Bootstrapping (The Core Engine) - **STATUS: COMPLETED**

**Current State:**
*   `src/core/bootstrap/Container.ts` is the main entry point.
*   `src/core/bootstrap/ServiceFactory.ts` handles object creation.
*   `src/core/bootstrap/YamlLoader.ts` loads configuration.

**Target State:**
*   src/index.ts is minimal and mode-agnostic:
    ```typescript
    const config = YamlLoader.load('bootstrap.yaml');
    const container = new Container(config);
    container.boot();
    ```
*   The **Container** instantiates the exact same core classes for both Sim and Live.

**Required Changes:**
1.  **YamlLoader**: A utility to read and merge the 5 YAML files. (Done)
2.  **ServiceFactory**: A class that takes a string name and returns an instance. (Done)
3.  **DependencyContainer**: Holds the singletons (Bus, Adapters) and injects them into Agents. (Done)

### B. Infrastructure & Event Bus (Postgres-Backed) - **STATUS: COMPLETED**

**Current State:**
*   `PostgresAdapter` and `PostgresEventStore` are implemented.
*   `PersistencePort` and `EventBusPort` interfaces are defined.

**Target State:**
*   **PostgresEventBus** is the single source of truth for both Live and Simulation.
*   **infrastructure.yaml** example:
    ```yaml
    event_bus:
      type: "postgres"
      connection: ""
      table_name: "events"
    ```

**Required Changes:**
1.  **Interface IEventBus**: Standardize publish() and subscribe(). (Done)
2.  **Implementation**: Ensure PostgresEventBus is robust and can handle the load. (Done)
3.  **Factory Logic**: The Bootstrapper initializes the bus before any agents. (Done)

### C. MCP & Tools (Generative Mocks) - **STATUS: COMPLETED**

**Current State:**
*   `McpToolProvider` interface created.
*   All internal adapters (`Shopify`, `Ads`, `Trend`, `Competitor`, `Fulfilment`, `Email`, `Ai`) are wrapped with `McpToolProvider` implementations.
*   `mcp-server.ts` entry point created and functional.

**Target State:**
*   **Live Mode**: Adapters wrap real API calls (Shopify, Meta).
*   **Sim Mode**: Adapters are **Generative Mocks**.
    *   They do NOT just return static data.
    *   They generate realistic responses (e.g., MockResearchTool returns a JSON of trending products generated by an LLM or a randomized algorithm).
    *   They maintain internal state (e.g., MockShopify keeps a list of "created" products in memory).

**Required Changes:**
1.  **Smart Mocks**: Implement MockShopifyAdapter, MockResearchAdapter that behave like the real systems. (Pending - Next Phase)
2.  **Stateful Simulation**: Mocks should share state where necessary (e.g., Inventory). (Pending - Next Phase)
3.  **MCP Wrappers**: Wrap all adapters with `McpToolProvider` implementations. (Done)

### D. Workflow Wiring (The Nervous System) - **STATUS: COMPLETED**

**Current State:**
*   `WorkflowManager` implemented.
*   `workflows.yaml` is read at startup.
*   Agents are automatically subscribed to events based on configuration.
*   `BaseAgent` has a fallback `handleEvent` method.

**Target State:**
*   Logic flow is defined in **workflows.yaml**.
    ```yaml
    subscriptions:
      - event: "RESEARCH_REQUESTED"
        subscriber: "research_agent"
        action: "find_products"
    ```

**Required Changes:**
1.  **Subscription Manager**: Registers subscriptions on the Event Bus at boot time. (Done)
2.  **Agent Handlers**: Agents need to implement the specific action methods (e.g., `find_products`). (In Progress - `ProductResearchAgent` and `CEOAgent` implemented)

## 3. Next Steps

1.  **Smart Mocks**: Implement the generative logic for the mock adapters. (Started - `MockTrendAdapter` and `MockAiAdapter` are now smart)
2.  **Agent Implementation**: Continue implementing methods for other agents (`SupplierAgent`, `StoreBuildAgent`, etc.).
3.  **Simulation Driver**: Ensure `SimulationOrchestrator` can trigger the initial events to start the flow. (Verified with `test-workflow.ts`)
2.  **Standardized Event Handlers**: Agents implement a common interface to receive events.

### E. Simulation vs. Live Mode (Orchestration)

**Current State:**
*   SimulationService drives the app procedurally.

**Target State:**
*   **Live Mode**: WebhookIngress receives real world events.
*   **Sim Mode**: SimulationOrchestrator injects **Random/Scripted Events**.
    *   It does NOT manage Agent workflows.
    *   It acts as the "Chaos Monkey" or "User Traffic Generator".
    *   Example: It emits TREND_DETECTED or ORDER_RECEIVED at random intervals to see how the Agents react.

**Required Changes:**
1.  **SimulationOrchestrator**: A service configured by scenario.yaml to emit events over time.
2.  **WebhookIngress**: A service that maps external webhooks to internal events.
