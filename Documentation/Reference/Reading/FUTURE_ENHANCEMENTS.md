## 🧠 CEO Agent (The Strategist)
*   📅 **KPI Sentinel**: Automatically monitor critical metrics (ROAS, Net Profit, Conversion Rate) every hour. Alert the user immediately if metrics dip below thresholds.
*   📅 **Pivot Logic**: Ability to decide when to "kill" a product (stop ads, archive product) based on performance data, not just user input.
*   📅 **Budget Allocation**: Dynamically move budget between the Marketing Agent's campaigns based on which platform is performing best.
*   📅 **Legal & Compliance**: Ensure the business adheres to GDPR/CCPA and tax regulations by instructing other agents to update policies.

## 🕵️ Product Research Agent (The Hunter)
*   📅 **Saturation Analysis**: Before recommending a product, check how many other Shopify stores are selling it using image reverse search.
*   📅 **Seasonality Check**: Cross-reference product keywords with Google Trends to ensure it's not a fading fad or seasonal item (unless intended).
*   📅 **Content Scraper**: Automatically download high-quality video/image assets from supplier pages (without watermarks) for the Marketing Agent to use.
*   📅 **Margin Calculator**: Factor in estimated CPA (Cost Per Acquisition) and shipping costs to predict *net* profit, not just gross margin.

## 📦 Supplier Agent (The Negotiator)
*   📅 **Sample Ordering**: Automate the process of ordering a sample unit to the business owner's address for quality verification.
*   📅 **Backup Sourcing**: Always identify 2-3 backup suppliers for every winning product to prevent stockouts if the primary supplier fails.
*   📅 **Quality Control**: Analyze text reviews on AliExpress/Amazon for keywords like "broken", "cheap", "slow" to assign a "Quality Risk Score".
*   📅 **Shipping Verification**: Periodically test-order to verify if "12-day shipping" is actually true.

## 🏗️ Store Build Agent (The Architect)
*   📅 **Review Importation**: Scrape positive reviews from the supplier source, translate them, and import them into the Shopify product page (using apps like Loox or Judge.me).
*   📅 **Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)**: Automatically add trust badges, sticky "Add to Cart" buttons, and urgency timers (if ethical) to product pages.
*   📅 **Legal Page Generation**: Auto-generate Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and Refund Policy pages tailored to the specific niche.
*   📅 **A/B Testing**: Create two versions of a product description or headline and track which one converts better.

## 📢 Marketing Agent (The Promoter)
*   📅 **Creative Generation**: Use DALL-E 3 or Midjourney to generate unique lifestyle images for products (e.g., "Yoga mat on a beach at sunset").
*   📅 **Video Editing**: Use FFmpeg or cloud video APIs to stitch together supplier clips into a 15-second TikTok ad with overlay text and music.
*   📅 **Influencer Outreach**: Scrape Instagram/TikTok for micro-influencers in the niche and draft personalized DM scripts for collaboration.
*   📅 **Email Flows**: Set up "Abandoned Cart" and "Welcome Series" email sequences in Klaviyo automatically.
*   📅 **Comment Management**: Monitor comments on ads and auto-hide spam or auto-reply to questions.

## 🤝 Customer Service Agent (The Diplomat)
*   📅 **Order Modification**: Allow customers to change their shipping address automatically if the order hasn't been fulfilled yet.
*   📅 **Refund Logic**: Implement a decision tree to auto-approve refunds under $20 to save time, but escalate higher amounts.
*   📅 **Dispute Fighter**: Auto-generate evidence files (tracking numbers, delivery proof) to fight chargebacks on Stripe/PayPal.
*   📅 **Live Chat Simulation**: Act as a real-time chatbot on the store using the knowledge base.

## 🚚 Operations Agent (The Manager)
*   📅 **Fraud Detection**: Analyze high-risk orders (different billing/shipping, high value) and flag them for manual review before fulfillment.
*   📅 **Cash Flow Management**: Track daily spend vs. daily payout schedules to ensure the bank account never goes negative.
*   📅 **Inventory Sync**: If a supplier runs out of stock, immediately mark the product as "Sold Out" on Shopify to prevent unfulfillable orders.
*   📅 **Tax Calculation**: Estimate sales tax obligations based on customer location.

## 📊 Analytics Agent (The Data Scientist)
*   📅 **Attribution Modeling**: Determine which ad actually caused the sale (First Click vs. Last Click).
*   📅 **Cohort Analysis**: Track the Lifetime Value (LTV) of customers acquired in specific months.
*   📅 **Competitor Benchmarking**: Compare the store's conversion rate against industry averages for that niche.
*   ✅ **Profit & Loss (P&L)**: Generate a real-time P&L statement that accounts for COGS, Ad Spend, Transaction Fees, and Subscription costs. (Implemented via `generate_report` tool).
